# The Implementation of the Upload Button for the DT Platform

## /lib/SceneInit.js

The `ModelRender` class provides a ready-to-use boilerplate for setting up and rendering a 3D scene using Three.js. This includes setting up the camera, lighting, and other mundane tasks to create a simple canvas for viewing the scene.

## /lib/ModelRend.js

This file contains utility functions to load 3D models (GLTF and FBX formats) and set up animations and an animation loop using Three.js.

### **1. `setupAnimations(model, mixers)`**

This function initializes and plays animations for a given model.
- **Parameters**:
  - `model`: A model object (e.g., from `GLTFLoader` or `FBXLoader`), which may include animation clips.
  - `mixers`: An array to store `AnimationMixer` instances. This allows managing animations for multiple models simultaneously.

- **Behavior**:
  - Detects and sets up all animations found in the model.
  - Starts playing animations immediately upon setup.

### **2. `loadGLTFModel(scene, path, position, rotation, scale)`**

Loads a GLTF/GLB model, applies transformations, and adds it to the provided scene.

- **Parameters**:
  - `scene`: The Three.js scene where the model will be added.
  - `path`: Path to the `.gltf` or `.glb` file.
  - `position`: An array `[x, y, z]` for the model's position.
  - `rotation`: A rotation angle (in radians) for the Y-axis.
  - `scale`: An array `[x, y, z]` for the model's scale.

- **Returns**:
  - A `Promise` that resolves with the loaded GLTF model object.

---

### **3. `loadFBXModel(scene, path, position, scale)`**

Loads an FBX model, applies transformations, and adds it to the provided scene.

- **Parameters**:
  - `scene`: The Three.js scene where the model will be added.
  - `path`: Path to the `.fbx` file.
  - `position`: An array `[x, y, z]` for the model's position.
  - `scale`: An array `[x, y, z]` for the model's scale.

- **Returns**:
  - A `Promise` that resolves with the loaded FBX object.

---

### **4. `setupAnimationLoop(test, mixers, clock)`**

Creates a render loop to synchronize animations and updates for a scene.

- **Parameters**:
  - `test`: An object containing the `render()` and `controls.update()` methods, typically the Three.js renderer and controls.
  - `mixers`: An array of `AnimationMixer` instances for controlling animations.
  - `clock`: A `THREE.Clock` instance to calculate the delta time for animation updates.

- **Behavior**:
  - Updates all animation mixers with the delta time at each frame.
  - Calls `render()` for rendering the scene and `update()` for OrbitControls or other camera controls.

## /lib/uploadUtilis.js
This module exports a createFileUploader function that handles the process of uploading 3D model files (.gltf, .glb, .fbx) to a Supabase storage bucket. It creates a dynamic file input element, validates the file type, and uploads the file to Supabase using the supabase.storage.from().upload() method. The fileâ€™s name is uniquely generated using uuidv4() to prevent collisions. The function tracks the upload progress and updates the UI through the setUploadProgress callback. Upon successful upload, it retrieves a public URL for the file.
